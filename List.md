        Learned Things Today

        Different between package.json and package-lock.json
        One is instruction and the other is information

        Learned command such as ps aux | grep start
        Where it looks for the process that is running

        You can kill these process by kill -KILL and adding the ID number

        Other commands are
        grep -rnl "browserslist" .
        grep -r "browserslist" .
        ps aux | grep npm

        sudo npm install -g npm@latest
        Sudo means that it will install for every project rather than just in one project
